ENTITY latch1 IS
	PORT ( A:IN STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(7 DOWNTO 0); --8 bit A input
				Resetn, Clock : IN STD_LOGIC; --1 bit clock input and 1 bit reset input bit
				Q : OUT STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(7 DOWNTO 0)); --8 bit output
		
END latch1;
ARCHITECTURE Behavior OF latch1 IS
	BEGIN 
		PROCESS ( Resetn, Clock ) -- process takes reset and clock as inputs
		BEGIN 
			IF Resetn = '0' THEN --when reset intput is '0' the latch does not operate
				Q <= "00000000";
			ELSIF Clock'EVENT AND Clock='1' THEN --level sensitive based on clock
				Q <= A; --output is the value captured from A
			END IF;
		END PROCESS;
END Behavior;
